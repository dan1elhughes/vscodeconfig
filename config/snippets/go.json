  // Place your snippets for go here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
  // description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
  // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
  // same ids are connected.
  // Example:
  "Take a distsync.Lock": {
    "prefix": "lock",
    "body": [
      "lock, err := distsync.Lock(req, body.${1:Id})",
      "if err != nil {",
      "\treturn typhon.Response{Error: err}",
      "}",
      "defer lock.Unlock()"
    ],
    "description": "Take a distsync.Lock"
  },
  "Slog debug": {
    "prefix": "debug",
    "body": "slog.Debug(ctx, \"${1}: %+v\", ${1})",
    "description": "Slog debug"
  }
